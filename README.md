Features
Accurate Fare Prediction: Get reliable fare estimates based on real-time data and machine learning models.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple input forms and intuitive design for ease of use.
Continuous Learning: The model is periodically updated with new data to enhance prediction accuracy.
Transparent Pricing: Provides users with clear fare expectations, helping to avoid unexpected costs.
Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://https://github.com/tusharpnwar/Taxi-Fare-Prediction-using-ML/

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application:

python app.py

Usage
Open the app by running app.py.
Enter your pickup and drop-off locations.
The app will calculate and display the estimated fare for your ride.
Review the estimate and plan your journey accordingly.
Files and Folders
README.md: Documentation for the project.
app.py: Main application file to run the app.
main.py: Script to handle the backend logic, including model predictions.
cabdata.csv: Dataset containing historical cab ride data used for training the model.
model.pkl: Pre-trained machine learning model serialized for use in the app.
requirements.txt: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the app.
style.css: Contains the styling information for the app's UI.

Model Training
The fare prediction model is built using the data from cabdata.csv and trained using machine learning techniques.

Steps to Train the Model:
Prepare the Dataset:

Load and preprocess the data from cabdata.csv.
Perform feature extraction and engineering to enhance model inputs.
Train the Model:

Use main.py to train the model on the processed data.
Save the trained model as model.pkl for future use.
Evaluate and Tune:

Evaluate the model's performance using test data.
Adjust hyperparameters as needed for better accuracy.
Deploy:

Integrate the trained model in app.py for real-time fare predictions.
