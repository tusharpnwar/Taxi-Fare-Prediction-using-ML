# Fare-Wise: Navigating Taxi Fares with Predictive Modelling

**Author:** Tushar Panwar

## Project Overview

Fare-Wise is a machine learning project designed to predict taxi fares based on various features like distance, time, and location. The goal is to build an accurate predictive model that can help users estimate the cost of a taxi ride before they book it.

## Introduction

Taxi fares can be unpredictable, and this project aims to bring more transparency by developing a predictive model. By analyzing historical data and various features, we can forecast fares with a high degree of accuracy.

## Features

- **Data Collection:** Collects and preprocesses data from various sources.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creates new features such as distance, time of day, and traffic conditions.
- **Modeling:** Implements and compares various machine learning models to find the best fit.
- **Prediction:** Provides accurate fare predictions based on the trained model.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://https://github.com/tusharpnwar/Taxi-Fare-Prediction-using-ML
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd fare-wise
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:
    - Ensure your dataset is in the correct format as expected by the model.

2. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py --dataset_path /path/to/your/dataset.csv
    ```

3. Make predictions:
    ```bash
    python predict.py --input_data /path/to/input/data.csv
    ```

4. View the results:
    - The results will be output to a specified file or displayed in the terminal.

## Modeling Process

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
2. **Feature Selection:** Choosing the most relevant features for prediction.
3. **Model Training:** Using algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
4. **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model parameters to improve accuracy.

## Results

- **Best Model:** Gradient Boosting achieved the highest accuracy with an RMSE of 2.34.
- **Feature Importance:** Distance, time of day, and pickup location were the most influential features.
- **Comparison:** Gradient Boosting outperformed other models by 15% in terms of accuracy.
